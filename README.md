# Linear-and-Polynomial-Regression-with-Scikit-Learn
This project applies both **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** techniques to model relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It showcases the limitations of linear models on non-linear data and how polynomial terms help improve model performance.
